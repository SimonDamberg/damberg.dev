# Hello there

*General Kenobi...* No, this is not [r/prequelmemes](https://reddit.com/r/prequelmemes), this is my tech blog! I'm Simon Damberg, a 22 year old software engineer from Västerås, Sweden. I am studying M.Sc. Computer and Information Engineering Student at Uppsala University and I also work as the Lead Software Engineer at Qognica Finance, delivering realtime forecasts of stock prices to your pocket with [QapSel](https://qapsel.com). I use everything from Python, Flask & PostgreSQL to Redis, React & React Native, and I'm always looking for new challenges to learn and grow my skills.

The first project I will cover on this blog is the development of my own Raspberry Pi Cluster to educate myself on Kubernetes, Ansible, and much more! The cluster will host a number of different services, which I will explain as implement them.
